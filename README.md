### A quick, REALLY unnecessarily design-patterned job-search record keeper

This project is, again, partly design pattern practice and mostly just something I wrote to make my life easier.

- On first run, just type in `python main.py new`

- On subsequent runs, just go `python main.py`

- Other than that, there's quite a few quick-entry features:
  - You can disobey the menu, and if you enter more than one keystroke while in the main menu, the program assumes you wanted to make another application.
  - Application quantities default to one, so if you're only applying for one position, just type the company name.
